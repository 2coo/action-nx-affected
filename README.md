## Making changes and pushing releases

- make new branch and make changes
- `npm run all`
- `git commit/push changes`
- make PR back to main
- wait for pipelines to finish (test will always finish with an error since this isn't a nx monorepo)
- `git checkout main`
- `git pull`
- `git tag v1`
- `SKIP_HOOKS=true git push origin v1`
- in github, edit tag and save (this will push to marketplace)


## NPM Check
```
npm run npm:check
```
